#**Markovsky**#

Markovsky uses MongoDB and Hidden Markov Chains (with a twist) to analyze and imitate harmonic trends across artists, genres, and eras.  Markovsky writes music to imitate trends and exports the music straight to MIDI -- ready to use with your favorite DAW and capable of taking up any number of voices.
