#**Markovsky**#

Markovsky uses MongoDB and Hidden Markov Chains (with a twist) to analyze and imitate harmonic trends across artists, genres, and eras.  Markovsky writes music based on these trends and exports it straight to MIDI -- ready to use with your favorite DAW and capable of taking up any number of voices.  Several MIDI tracks can be written at once, offering multiple voices and parts over the same chord progression.
